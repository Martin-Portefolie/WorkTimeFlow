# TODOS
## CRITICAL
- the status site and controller dosnt work corrctly, wrong dates, wrong times, expected from timelogs, not todos.
## HIGH
- Csrf token error, where a reload is needed, happens often.
- ./templates/admin/company/index.html.twig:  Cant delete, when first set in project
## MEDIUM 
- update project/new.html.twig: Should be able to add all values, without updating afterwards.
- update the language model, it's starting to get messy.
- ./templates/time-register/index.html.twig doesn't have translation
- ./templates/user/index.html.twig doesn't  have translation
## LOW
- in Assets/controller, structure the js better.
- in Form, cleanup. Put Clients into Admin folder
- ./templates/login/index.html.twig:
